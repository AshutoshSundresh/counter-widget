# Japa Mala Counter Widget

This is a simple Japa Mala counter widget implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The counter widget displays a count and a round number. The count increments by one each time the `plusCount` function is called, and resets to zero when it reaches 108. At the same time, the round number increments by one. The total is calculated as the sum of the count and the product of the round number 108.

The widget also includes an image that changes between two frames of a mala each time the count is incremented.

## Usage

To use this widget, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The count, round, and total are displayed on the page and will update automatically as described above.
