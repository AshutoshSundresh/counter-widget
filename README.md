# Japa Mala Counter Widget

This is a simple Japa Mala counter widget implemented in a Next.js app using TypeScript, React, and NextUI.

## Description

The counter widget displays a count and a round number. The count increments by one each time the `plusCount` function is called and resets to zero when it reaches 108. Simultaneously, the round number increments by one. 

The widget also includes an image that changes between two frames of a mala each time the count is incremented.

## Usage

To use this widget, run the Next.js app and open it in a web browser. The count, round, and total are displayed on the page and will update automatically as described above.
